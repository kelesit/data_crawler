The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 1.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.1%.But the rebound wasn't enough to overcome losses earlier in the week.

Today at 4:30 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  A look at the week ahead   The holidays have arrived and investors wishing for a Santa Claus rally are in for a relative trickle of economic news but high drama in Washington.With no notable earnings on the docket, the major driver for the market remains tug-of-war between President-elect Trump and Congressional Republicans. After two deals collapsed the federal government is on course for a stoppage this weekend.Hanging over the political turmoil is the market reaction to the Federal Reserve. Investors are still figuring out how to react to what is seen as a newly hawkish tone from the US central bank, which has signaled that fewer interest rate cuts are coming next year.The "higher for longer" policy stance has been discussed for months. But the initial reaction to the Fed's hawkish cut was to pull back.Markets will close early on Tuesday and won't reopen until Thursday in observance of the Christmas holiday.Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:    Today at 3:51 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks roar back but head for weekly losses  Wall Street shook off its apprehensions from morning trading and roared back on Friday, sending all three gauges up more than 1.5%.Investors, spooked from the newly hawkish tone of the Federal Reserve, fled from stocks earlier in the day. But they were lifted up by a fresh reading from the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, which showed that, excluding volatile categories like food and energy, price increases fell month over month in November, even as they remained sticky.The momentum shift wasn't enough to overcome earlier losses, however.For the week the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was set to lose 1.2%, according to late-afternoon trading prices. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to lose 1.6% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 1.9%.

The once iconic chipmaker posted the biggest loss in its 56-year history in its latest quarterly earnings report.

Today at 2:15 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  The US government could be headed for a shutdown  The United States government could be headed for a shutdown this weekend after two failed attempts by House Republicans in recent days to avert a stoppage, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul.First, Speaker Mike Johnson and his colleagues saw one bipartisan deal fall apart amid opposition from Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump. Then a second GOP-negotiated deal collapsed due to 38 House Republicans joining nearly all Democrats to vote no and tank that effort.Johnson and his colleagues are still working feverishly to resolve a complex series of disputes on issues from the debt ceiling to various funding priorities but now have only hours to act to head off an array of impacts that could be felt across the country, as well as economic impacts that could grow with each passing day.Many of America's more than 2 million federal employees (and another 2 million military personnel) could either find themselves furloughed, working without pay, or simply dealing with shutdown-related disruptions.Read more about the Washington showdown and the potential impacts on the market here.   Today at 1:35 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks rise in afternoon trading   The positive turn on Wall Street continued to gather steam Friday afternoon as investors appeared to buy back in following encouraging inflation data and looked past the potential for a government shutdown in Washington.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 1.8%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) put on 1.9%.All three major gauges started the trading day in the red, dragged down by the perception that the Federal Reserve initiated a "hawkish cut" on Wednesday. But the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November, lifting sentiment.   Today at 12:45 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Why the Fed's Beth Hammack is not in favor of latest 25bps rate cut  The lone dissenter to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut this week said she voted against the move because “there is more work to do on inflation,” noting she preferred to pause given the strength of the US economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger.“Based on my estimate that monetary policy is not far from a neutral stance, I prefer to hold policy steady until we see further evidence that inflation is resuming its path to our 2% objective,” said Beth Hammack, the president of the Cleveland Fed, in a statement Friday.Hammack said her decision was a “close call” but that she believes “monetary policy will need to remain modestly restrictive for some time.”Fed officials scaled back the number of cuts they expect in 2025, largely due to concerns about persistent inflation.Read more about internal disagreements as the Fed continues to battle inflation heading into 2025.

Fri, December 20, 2024 at 9:37 PM GMT+8 Alexandra Canal  Fed's preferred inflation gauge: Price increases fall in November but still sticky  The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025, with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm.In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase.Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%.    Fri, December 20, 2024 at 9:00 PM GMT+8 Alexandra Canal  Here comes another inflation report...  Investors this morning will. e closely monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy.The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data.Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October.Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase.The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025, with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase.In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected."We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."   Fri, December 20, 2024 at 8:35 PM GMT+8 Alexandra Canal  Good morning.
