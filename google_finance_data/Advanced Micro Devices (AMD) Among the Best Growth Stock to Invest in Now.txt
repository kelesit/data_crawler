On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market.Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric.

He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year.“It’s a Bullish Environment for Big Tech”Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future.
